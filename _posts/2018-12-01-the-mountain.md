Recently I completed a life long dream of mine to work at Google. This had been an implicit goal since I was about 8 and an explicit goal since 16 when I started programming. Since 19 I designed my life around trying to get a "good" job with the implicit assumption that Google was the standard for "good". Even as their ethics have been called into question most people still revere them as a company that employs only the top 1% of engineers. They are a mountain -- massive, cold, and above all indifferent to those foolish enough to attempt to reach the summit.

## Climbing the Mountain

While I was working at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) for my second internship, which I got almost entirely because of [my side project](https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler), I met a fellow intern who had worked at Google in a non engineering role previously and was now trying to make it as a software engineer. After forming a friendship by eating lunch with them, going on walk breaks, and helping with some programming problems they, at my request, reached out to previous colleagues that worked at Google to recommend me after I submitted my resume.

It took two months from when I first contacted them to receive an automated interview invitation with two questions on it. I blocked off a Sunday morning and finished it in about 2 hours. After two more months of silence, at which point I thought I was forgotten about, I was given a new recruiter and scheduled for two live phone interviews.

I scheduled the interviews back to back, and took off a day from work in order to accommodate them. The first went fine, the second one had a technical issue where every time I spoke I heard myself a second later reverberated back to me. The interviewer was indifferent to my request for him to fix his microphone and the interview went terribly. I made sure to mention it to my recruiter so it wouldn't be marked against me and another interview was scheduled. I blocked off another day from work and this last one went smoothly. There was then two weeks of silence.

I was then notified that I would continue on to the intern matching phase, where I was still not guaranteed a position. I made a profile attempting to highlight all my experiences, including seemingly irrelevant facts like that I had dual citizenship or that I had also secured an internship at Microsoft while I was waiting for Google to respond during those long breaks of silence. I had three teams interested in me that were quickly scheduled in January. They all liked me and in the end I chose the Chrome Protector team which was based in Montréal.

I worked with them for three months building out a whole new feature complete with design documents, privacy request documents, unit and integration tests, about 5 thousand lines of C++ code implementing the feature, OKRs for all of this, and finally daily "snippets" detailing what I worked on that day, every day for 12 weeks.

In order to seem more hireable I also contributed informal documentation to a mailing list about Wayland that was looking into it for internal use. I also went to a security off-site where I contributed to sensitive discussions about the state of browser security (which, in accordance with the NDA I was obliged to sign, I'm not allowed to talk about).

In tandem with all of the above I was also studying for interviews. Unlike Microsoft and Intuit, which had given me offers at the end of the internship after they were impressed with my performance, you must complete two additional interviews in order to be considered for full time at Google. These would be at the same caliber as those that are interviewing for full time, and it would be weighed alongside your internship performance when the committee was considering you. The internship was weighed slightly heavier, but both were important.

I read Programming Pearls (which makes for some fun light reading) and Cracking the Coding Interview (second only to counting the number of spots on the sun for how painful it is to yours retinas), scheduled two separate mock interviews with full time employees in order to practice, and had mock interviews every week with my fellow interns.

I interviewed about two weeks before my internship ended after which I finished up my project. My manager was happy with the project according to our exit interview and reassured me in all of our weekly "check up" meetings that we were having up until that point that my work was appreciated. When I left my colleagues were looking forward to me returning, one of them even correcting me from "if I return" to "when I return".

A month and a half after the internship ended I was informed the hiring committee was not sufficiently impressed and I would not be receiving an offer. They elected not to tell me the reason.

## Falling Down the Mountain
Recently I've been playing [Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy](http://www.foddy.net/2017/09/getting-over-it/). You might remember it from about a year ago when it was a craze among streamers. Because of this it attracted a certain reputation as being irrelevant trash which is unfortunate. It _is_ trash (Bennett Foddy himself said so in the game itself), but it's also a thought provoking game because it explores the theme of frustration.

When I play Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy I re-live that final phone call from my Google recruiter every time I inevitably fall down the mountain.

The feeling is always the same, no matter how careful and deliberate I am or how hard I try to curb my expectations. Frustration of a unique sort that is hard to find anywhere else. I tense up, as if expecting a punch. Coldness sweeps over me, as sweat pools in undesirable places. My stomach drops and seems to fall out of me, away from me, as if in disgust.

Each careful movement of the hammer as I navigate up the mountain is a direct parallel to each calculated step I took: working on side projects in my spare time so that FAANG wanna-be companies will hire me, studying contrived interview questions to pass interviews, actually working as a software engineer at the not-quite-Googles so there's a fallback plan in case of failure.

After falling down the mountain a little disparaging clip plays as the second wave of frustration washes over me. This one is a steamy cocktail of shame, regret, and hopelessness. It is paralyzing, urging me to quit before I suffer through that embarrassing defeat again. The pithy quotes, so much verbal fodder as the pitying comments offered to me by friends and loved ones, only fans the flames of rage I direct at myself.

However, I have been conditioned. Years of self-flagellation have made it impossible for me to back down once my pride has been bruised. I beat my head mercilessly against the wall, knowing it will break before I do.

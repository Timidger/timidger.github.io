Disclaimer: unlike most content I write, this is not going to be technical.

Recently I completed a life long dream of mine to work at Google. This had been an implicit goal since I was about 8 and an explicit goal since 16 when I started programming. Since 19 I designed my life around trying to get a "good" job with the implicit assumption that Google was the standard for "good". Even as their ethics have been called into question most people still revere them as a company that employs only the top 1% of engineers. 

So away I climbed.

## Climbing the Mountain

While I was working at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) for my second internship, which I got almost entirely because of [my side project](https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler), I met a fellow intern who had worked at Google in a non engineering role previously and was now trying to make it as a software engineer. After forming a friendship by eating lunch with them, going on walk breaks, and helping with some programming problems they, at my request, reached out to previous colleagues that worked at Google to recommend me after I submitted my resume.

It took two months from when I first contacted them to receive an automated interview invitation with two questions on it. I blocked off a Sunday morning and finished it in about 2 hours. After two more months of silence, at which point I thought I was forgotten about, I was given a new recruiter and scheduled for two live phone interviews.

I scheduled the interviews back to back, and took off a day from work in order to accommodate them. The first went fine, the second one had a technical issue where every time I spoke I heard myself a second later reverberated back to me. The interviewer was indifferent to my request for him to fix his microphone and the interview went terribly. I made sure to mention it to my recruiter so it wouldn't be marked against me and another interview was scheduled. I blocked off another day from work and this last one went smoothly. There was then two weeks of silence.

I was then notified that I would continue on to the intern matching phase, where I was still not guaranteed a position. I made a profile attempting to highlight all my experiences, including seemingly irrelevant facts like that I had dual citizenship or that I had also secured an internship at Microsoft while I was waiting for Google to respond during those long breaks of silence. I had three teams interested in me that were quickly scheduled in January. They all liked me and in the end I chose the Chrome Protector team which was based in Montréal.

I worked with them for three months building out a whole new feature complete with design documents, privacy request documents, unit and integration tests, about 5 thousand lines of C++ code implementing the feature, OKRs for all of this, and finally daily "snippets" detailing what I worked on that day, every day for 12 weeks.

In order to seem more hireable I also contributed informal documentation to a mailing list about Wayland that was looking into it for internal use. I also went to a security off-site where I contributed to sensitive discussions about the state of browser security (which, in accordance with the NDA I was obliged to sign, I'm not allowed to talk about).

In tandem with all of the above I was also studying for interviews. Unlike Microsoft and Intuit, which had given me offers at the end of the internship after they were impressed with my performance, you must complete two additional interviews in order to be considered for full time at Google. These would be at the same caliber as those that are interviewing for full time, and it would be weighed alongside your internship performance when the committee was considering you. The internship was weighed slightly heavier, but both were important.

I read Programming Pearls (which I strongly suggest as light reading) and Cracking the Coding Interview (which I strongly _don't_ suggest as lightly reading), scheduled two separate mock interviews with full time employees in order to practice, and had mock interviews every week with my fellow interns.

I interviewed about two weeks before my internship ended after which I finished up my project. My manager was happy with the project according to our exit interview and reassured me in all of our weekly "check up" meetings that we were having up until that point that my work was appreciated. When I left my colleagues were looking forward to me returning, one of them even correcting me from "if I return" to "when I return".

A month and a half after the internship ended I was informed the hiring committee was not sufficiently impressed and I would not be receiving an offer. They elected not to tell me the reason.

## Falling Down the Mountain
Recently I've been playing [Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy](http://www.foddy.net/2017/09/getting-over-it/). You might remember it from about a year ago when it was a craze among streamers. Because of this it attracted a certain reputation as being irrelevant trash which is unfortunate. It _is_ trash (Bennett Foddy himself said so in the game itself), but it's also a thought provoking game because it explores the theme of frustration.

[Watch this video to see what I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCcA4FyWeXI&t=3s)

When I play Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy and inevitably fall down the mountain the feeling I get is the same feeling I got during that final phone call from my Google recruiter.

When you climb the mountain you know it's possible you will fall just like when you interview with Google you can fall into the [Interview Anti-Loop](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html). Each careful movement of the hammer as you navigate up the mountain is a direct parallel to each calculated step you took along the way: getting good enough to pass through company's filters in order to interview, studying how to beat those interviews in your spare time, working on side projects in your spare time for free in order to seem more desirable to companies.

The experience you feel when you fall down the mountain is always the same, no matter how careful and deliberate you were or how hard you try to curb your expectations. Frustration of a unique sort that is hard to find anywhere else. You tense up, as if expecting a punch. Coldness sweeps over you, as sweat pools in undesirable places. Your stomach drops and seems to fall out of you, away from you, as if in disgust.

## Getting Over It
After you fall down the mountain you treated to a little disparaging clip as the second wave of frustration washes over you. This one is a steamy cocktail of shame, regret, and hopelessness. It is paralyzing, urging you to quit before you suffer through that embarrassing defeat again.

## // TODO
## // climbing back up the mountain => working again
## // getting better at certain parts => getting better at programing, resume building, networking, interviewing

Many people quit playing Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy before reaching the summit of the mountain. Most stopped because they decided that it's a trash game unworthy of their time. Some went away unhappy with the time they wasted on attempting an unachievable goal. A few put it down but told themselves they'll get back to it once they have more experience and are better equipped to deal with the hardships the mountain throws at you. A select few eventually picked it back up, again and again, after falling, again and again, until the summit was finally reached and the mountain defeated.

I'm not sure if I'll apply to Google again next year. The work was certainly interesting, but they have tricky, difficult problems to solve that code alone cannot solve. While I was there 3 separate [[1](https://twitter.com/kateconger/status/1030243849267015681?lang=en), [2](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/09/12/leaked-video-google-leaderships-dismayed-reaction-to-trump-election/), [3](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)], high profile leaks occurred. The last one culminated in the first company wide walkout against sexual harassment. I was there when [a Googler championed into a microphone "Fuck you leakers" to thunderous applause](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/jack-poulson-ex-google-says-management-obsessed-with-stopping-leaks-2018-12). It's not the shining utopia my younger self dreamed of.

Besides, even if I don't apply again I don't really see my rejection as a failure. I achieved my childhood dream and worked there for 12 exciting, frustrating (in a good way!) weeks. I'm very lucky to have experienced that.

It's time to find a new mountain to climb.

			<p>One of my favourite things about the internet are the sites that ooze with
authenticity. Ironically, my own web presence is very unauthentic &ndash; I don&rsquo;t put
many things out there and the one thing I am vaguely known for (Way Cooler) was
<a href="/way-cooler/2020-01-09-way-cooler-post-mortem">managed more like a product than as a labour of
love</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, here&rsquo;s a list of blogs/essays/sites from people that I&rsquo;ve found to
be authentic. Some of these people are controversial (and are probably people I
wouldn&rsquo;t get along with) but are never the less authentic.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://badspot.us/">badspot.us</a> - Creator of
<a href="http://blockland.us/">blockland</a> a small game that I played years ago whose
community has essentially died.</li>
<li><a href="http://danluu.com/">Dan Luu</a> - I may be the only one that actually enjoys the
lack of styling on his in-depth and high quality blog posts.</li>
<li><a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew Devault</a> - Great guy to have a beer so long as
you&rsquo;re not an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">&ldquo;enemy of open source&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">ESR</a> - Ultra conservative programmer known best
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a> - One of the best bloggers about &ldquo;System
Programming&rdquo; - usually talks about Linux or the networking stack.</li>
<li><a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case</a> - Creator of <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/467574">:the
game:</a>, a silly little flash
game. I remember playing it when it first came out and now it exists as a time
capsule containing society&rsquo;s fears and obsessions of the late 2000s era. She
went on to make some very insightful &ldquo;teaching games&rdquo; that explain ideas
really well. Her two best writings IMHO are <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/2010-2019/">her decade in
review</a> (which encouraged me to do the same,
though I kept mine private) and <a href="https://ncase.me/remember/">How to remember anything
forever-ish</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://notch.tumblr.com/">Notch</a> - Creator of Minecraft but now better known
for posting offensive transphobic tweets</li>

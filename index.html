						Rust recently released version 1.26 and with it a big change that has been in the pipeline quite a while: impl Trait syntax.
I won&rsquo;t go into the change itself (as it&rsquo;s a little involved, especially if you don&rsquo;t know Rust) and I won&rsquo;t give my opinion of the change because I haven&rsquo;t actually tried it yet so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a net win for the language yet.&hellip;

						While designing Way Cooler, it was decided early on that we wanted multiple different ways for the user to tile their windows. When you look around at all the different tiling window managers for X, it becomes apparent that there is no one-size-fits-all method. One of the primary goals of Way Cooler is to be as customizable as possible, so we want the user to choose the method that works best for them.&hellip;

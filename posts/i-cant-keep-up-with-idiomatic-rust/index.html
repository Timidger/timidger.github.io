			<p>Recently withoutboats posted a
<a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/failure-to-fehler/">series</a> of blog
<a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/why-ok-wrapping/">posts</a> about some syntax
sugar he would like added to Rust.</p>
<p>The gist of it is, as far as I can tell, there should be some way to not have to
write <code>Ok(...)</code> for the happy path in functions which return <code>Result</code>. He
specifically is advocating for a <code>throws</code> keyword that would go a bit beyond
just this basic change, but the problem he&rsquo;s mainly trying to fix is having to
type <code>Ok(...)</code> so often.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really been involved with the Rust community that much, especially
since I stopped working on Way Cooler. This isn&rsquo;t from lack of using Rust, I
use Rust in my day job after all, but rather from disinterest in getting
involved in what seems to be mostly bikeshedding. The <code>.await</code> war was the final
straw to make me stop watching the Rust community beyond what comes in the
release notes.</p>
<p>So in many ways I&rsquo;m coming into this argument as an outsider &ndash; I have not read
any thing beyond the two linked blog posts and am missing most of the discussion
that has gone on. I&rsquo;m not going to weigh in on <code>throws</code> vs some annotation vs
Fehler because even though I have an opinion I detest bikeshedding.</p>
<p>However, as a long time user of Rust (4 years, wow how time flies!) the
constantly changing standard of what constitutes &ldquo;idiomatic Rust&rdquo; is starting to
wear me down. <code>try!()</code> -&gt; <code>?</code>, the addition of <code>impl trait</code>, and the <code>dyn</code>
keyword are all features that have changed what it means to write idiomatic
Rust. When these features come out I need to now change my code in order to keep
it idiomatic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I hate these features. I remember being very happy when <code>?</code>
came about and <code>dyn</code> is certainly clearer than what we had before. However
having to make these superficial changes again and again causes churn in all my
codebases. Because Rust releases every 6 weeks that means every 6 weeks I might
need to make superficial changes to my codebase (not to mention potentially have
to do a major point release &ndash; using <code>impl</code> is an API breaking change).</p>
<p>So to bring my complaints back around to the issue at hand: if <code>Ok</code> wrapping
came in the next Rust release this would be another change that requires me to
update my code in order to be idiomatic. This isn&rsquo;t sustainable for me &ndash; I
appreciate Rust team&rsquo;s commitment to backwards compatibility but the constant
disregard for forwards-compatibility makes me feel like I&rsquo;m on a treadmill
trying, and failing, to keep up.</p>

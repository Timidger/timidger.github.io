# Active Projects
These are projects I'm actively working on. Help is very much appreciated, check the links to see how to get involved.
* [Way Cooler](http://way-cooler.org): A Wayland clone of [AwesomeWM](http://awesomewm.org) for [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/).
* [wlroots-rs](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs): A 100% safe Rust wrapper for [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots), a library to build Wayland compositors.

# Projects I Maintain
These are a list of projects that I will accept patches to but otherwise will not touch.
* [Wikia (Python API wrapper)](https://github.com/Timidger/Wikia): A wrapper for the Wikia API. Made for use in autowikiabot.

# Dead Projects
These are a list of projects that I will not accept patches for either because the library has better alternatives today or because it was a fun hack I did that I'm not using anymore.

* [rust-wlc](https://github.com/way-cooler/rust-wlc): A Rust wrapper for [wlc](https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc). It is suggested to use [wlc.rs](https://github.com/Drakulix/wlc.rs) or [wlroots-rs](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs) instead.
* [autowikiabot-py](https://github.com/Timidger/autowikiabot-py): A Reddit bot written in Python that gave summaries of links that were posted to the `http://wikia.com` domain.

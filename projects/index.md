# Projects

I don't have any major projects going on at the moment, but here's what I've
worked on in the paste:

* [Way Cooler](http://way-cooler.org): A Wayland clone of [AwesomeWM](http://awesomewm.org) for [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/).
* [todo](https://git.sr.ht/~timidger/todo): Personal task manager shaped to the way I deal with and think of tasks
* [wlroots-rs](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs): A 100% safe Rust wrapper for [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots), a library to build Wayland compositors.
* [rust-wlc](https://github.com/way-cooler/rust-wlc): A Rust wrapper for [wlc](https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc). It is suggested to use [wlc.rs](https://github.com/Drakulix/wlc.rs) or [wlroots-rs](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs) instead.
* [autowikiabot-py](https://github.com/Timidger/autowikiabot-py): A Reddit bot written in Python that gave summaries of links that were posted to the `http://wikia.com` domain.
* [Wikia (Python API wrapper)](https://github.com/Timidger/Wikia): A wrapper for the Wikia API. Made for use in autowikiabot.

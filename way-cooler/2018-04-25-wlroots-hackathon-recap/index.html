			<p>Hi all! Sorry for the radio silence. I&rsquo;ve been extremely busy with school but that should be finishing up very soon (I&rsquo;m typing this up as I wait for my last exam to start in fact).</p>
<p>As a recap of what&rsquo;s happened over the past two months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attended the wlroots hackathon in Philadelphia with the Sway team, which was a lot of fun and very productive.</li>
<li>Started moving Way Cooler over to wlroots (this is reflected in the master branch now).</li>
<li>Begun to stabilize the wlroots-rs API.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pretty-picture-update">Pretty Picture Update</h1>
<p>I know I showed you a similar image last time, but there&rsquo;s a lot more going on to make this picture possible:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/awesome_bar_in_way_cooler_wlroots.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That is the awesome bar being drawn in Lua using Cairo, rendered in Way Cooler using wlroots, with the weston-terminal being fully usable. So this is much closer to working.</p>
<h1 id="left-to-do">Left to do</h1>
<p>The stuff left to do is, in order of interestingness (to me):</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a better architecture for Awesome to work on Wayland
<ul>
<li>Since this is basically a rewrite it&rsquo;s possible to change how this works fairly drastically. Right now the design is based on multi-threads, but I&rsquo;m going to see if I can&rsquo;t get it down to one thread using <code>poll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write the code for compositing windows</li>
<li>Continue implementing the Awesome API</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also the order I&rsquo;m going to tackle this, since that list is in order of descending difficulty.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants to get involved, the gitter channel has now been deprecated! I will no longer be checking it and all communication should now be through #awesome on OFTC.</p>

<p>Way Cooler is going to be entering an official hibernation period for the next three months (as opposed to the unofficial hibernation period that it&rsquo;s currently in).</p>
<p>I will not be pushing any code for three months due to contractual obligations I have with Google. This limitation will be lifted on November 2nd, 2018.</p>
<p>Patches will still be accepted during that time, there just won&rsquo;t be any from me.</p>
<h1 id="wait-is-this-still-being-worked-on">Wait is this still being worked on??</h1>
<p>I still fully intend to see Way Cooler through to completion, however it&rsquo;s been very difficult to work on it recently due to various personal complications (back-to-back internships and schooling, constantly moving, aforementioned contractual obligations, and being forced to use Windows for three months a as a development environment which I wouldn&rsquo;t wish on my worst enemy). This will change in after November, as I&rsquo;ll have no obligations whatsoever for the rest of the year.</p>
<h1 id="so-why-is-this-thing-taking-so-long">So why is this thing taking so long?</h1>
<p>You can thank Gnome for that.</p>
<p>Gnome has had performance problems and <a href="https://anholt.github.io/twivc4/2018/05/30/twiv/">part of the problem</a> is having Javascript, an interpreted GC language, in the same thread as the compositor handling input and drawing to the screen. <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/GnomeShell/GnomeShell4">A hypothetical Gnome 4</a> would fix those problems, but for now it&rsquo;s too late for Gnome 3.</p>
<p>Way Cooler would run into similar problems with the current design as of <a href="https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/tree/46940d02bcef7c6980021da2244b5af8ab085a9e">today&rsquo;s master</a>. I&rsquo;m looking to fix those problems before they happen by splitting the program up into two binaries: <code>way-cooler</code> the compositor and <code>awesome</code> which acts just like today&rsquo;s awesome but written in Rust and talking Wayland to <code>way-cooler</code>.</p>
<p>This will mean more work, but a better experience at the end. In fact it already enables a feature that I couldn&rsquo;t do before with the old system: in place restart of the Lua thread without dropping clients. It&rsquo;s assumed <code>awesome</code> can be killed and restarted at any time, but <code>way-cooler</code> must always be running.</p>
